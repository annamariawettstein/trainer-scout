    "email_body": "Hi Hayden,\n\nI wanted to reach out personally because I've been reviewing our trainer feedback data and your name kept coming up in a really positive way.\n\nOver the past few months, we've seen strong improvement in your training scores and the feedback from learners has been genuinely impressive. Here's one that really stood out to me:\n\n\"Finding out about keyboard shortcuts was fun! And the bigger picture context (e.g. the 4 steps to clean data ready to analyse) were really interesting.\"\n\nThat kind of feedback tells us you're doing something right, and we'd love to capture and share what's working for you.\n\nWould you be up for helping us with two quick things?\n\n1. A short testimonial quote from you (just a sentence or two about your experience as a trainer with us)\n2. Either a 15-20 min chat or a quick written Q&A where we can learn more about your approach to training\n\nWe're building out some case studies and best practices to help other trainers, and your insights would be really valuable.\n\nJust reply to this email and let me know if you're interested. No pressure if you're swamped — I totally get it.\n\nThanks for being such a great part of the team!\n\nBest,\n[Your name]",
